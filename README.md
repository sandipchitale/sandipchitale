## Hi there

My name is Sandip Chitale. I am a full stack developer with a developer productivity mindset. Being an artists I am also interested in UI and my interest in productivity translates to UXD as well.

My philosopy is if you do the same task over and over and it can be automated, and then generalized into a tool - well that is what I do.

I have in the past worked on:

- Netbeans (Fun fact: those days I had a nickname Sandip 'Plugins' Chitale).
- Eclipse
- Aptana Studio

I also develop a lot of [IntelliJ plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/vendor/50612aa4-f7b0-4e48-b265-cee3952604e7) and [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/sandipchitale). I also know how to develop Chrome extension.
